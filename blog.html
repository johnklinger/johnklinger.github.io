      <h2>Why Send a Man to Jail</h2>
      <h5>Joel "The Warden" Anthony, Jan 19, 2025</h5>
      <img src="jail.png" class="image">

<p>
Prison is a foundation of liberal society yet in many ways it is a relic of pre-liberal thought. If we only ever believed in pure liberalism, that all men were equal, then the concept of prison would never cross our mind- we would simply assume all men were equally likely to reoffend. If our less enlightened ancestors had never created prisons, we never would’ve formed the trusting society that liberalism requires- in a world of violence, monopolizing violence would not come from votes. <b>With this inconsistency at its heart, I thought I’d look at the fundamental question of prison- “Who belongs there?”- and propose an alternative answer that I believe is an improvement.</b> <br><br>

First, we must answer the purpose of prison. The simplest understanding would be that prison is to punish- bad people go to jail. However, if we believed it was just about punishment, then why would we disallow “cruel & unusual punishment”? Some would say this ban is even more fundamental to our concept of rights than free speech. However, by any reasonable argument, you would say that <b>as a punishment taking twenty years of a man’s life is magnitudes crueler than simply lashing him or putting him in stockades- so if we judge it as a punishment at all, it goes against one of our core philosophies. Then prison's role in society can only be to reform or banish.</b> <br><br>

If prison is meant to reform, then who belongs there? People who need further education and assistance to be self-sufficient is part of the answer- but most of these can just work with social workers from home. To require prison, they must be a danger to society as well. <b>To warrant prison, prisoners must require further assistance to stop endangering society.</b> The actual method of reforming is out of scope for this essay, but we will assume that there is a group for whom reform is possible x% of the time.<br><br>

If prison is meant to banish, it would be for the same group as reform but where we see reform as highly improbable. We could say if someone is in prison until old age, they may as well be fully banished, because the version of them that could threaten society was meaningfully removed.<br><br>

The old age point is relevant because danger to society is extremely age dependent. From 16-24 there is a huge amount of antisocial activity, then a significantly lower amount from 24-44, then almost nothing afterwards. From this point of view, <b>much of what we would call “reform” is just holding people through their peak violence years and releasing them when they cool down.</b> Banishment would be waiting even longer for their aggression to go down.<br><br>

The peak crime years starting at 16 is interesting because at that age we still are juveniles- and hold ourselves to a far more relaxed standard. Also interesting is that from 16-18 we’re still under extremely heavy supervision by government employees- just in a school. If anybody does have a history of violence by that age, they have probably spent significant time with counselors and are more likely to have been held back a year, meaning they’ve spent even more time in the school system. <b>The behavior data in the school system increases exponentially with bad behavior.</b><br><br>

Now, let’s think about how we put people in jail today. We base it off a single crime, taking history into account. This seems fair- everybody knows the rules, and everybody understands the concept. But imagine if you actually robbed or killed someone- understanding it would be totally against your morals, and you’d feel disgusted- would you really think you deserve prison afterwards? I think most people would think “I’m different- surely you can see that?” and I believe that they would be right to say that. <b>Committing a crime doesn’t change who you are.</b> I think explicitly people understand it is all about likelihood to reoffend. Where I think we are wasting effort is obsessing over the prefix “re”.<br><br>

My theory is this: If instead of holding our breath and waiting for the inevitable, we simply trusted teachers when consensus is reached that a student is a ticking time bomb, and allowed the state to hold them until reform is noticed- <b>if we trusted the education system to judge criminal status, it would be much more accurate and even more fair than taking a single infraction as proof of character.</b><br><br>

Consider the plight of teachers today who know without a doubt that something bad is going to happen with a certain kid. This isn’t about mischievous bullies- these are genuine psychopaths. You don’t think teachers are aware of the patterns? <b>And they can only watch and see who the victim ends up being- powerless until someone is hurt, possibly scarred for life, to be used as a pawn to justify doing what should’ve been done all along.</b><br><br>

You might say that those kids can still change- that we don’t know what they’ll do until they do it. <b>You could say the exact same about somebody after they’ve committed an offense. Sure, they’ve committed a murder- but you don’t know that they’ll commit another one until they’ve actually done it?</b> Either way, this is a game of probabilities- and we’re ignoring our most relevant data points as if some are more honorable than others.<br><br>

The last point is about the principle of it all. What about bias? How do we know their judgement is accurate? Well, we already have parole boards, history, and literal judges as fundamental parts of the system. Who are we kidding, acting like this isn’t always going to be about judgement? <b>Teachers and counselors have seen all the warning signs before. Why are we waiting for an innocent person to be hurt before we treat them as warning signs? </b>

      <h2>3-2-1: Allocating focus, reframing your mind, and the power of systems</h2>
      <h5>Guru John Klinger, Nov 14, 2023</h5>
      <img src="worksucks.png" class="image">

<p>
Happy 3-2-1 Tuesday!<br><br>
Here are 3 ideas, 2 quotes, and 1 question to consider this week… <br>
<h2>3 Ideas from Me</h2>

I.<br><br>
&emsp;The difference between 110% and 100% is far greater than the difference between 80% and 70%. If you’re stuck on something, don’t be afraid to take a step back and redirect efforts towards something that is less urgent but gives you the ability to go over the top. Often, these extra efforts are all that others can notice.<br><br>
II.<br><br>
&emsp;It can be easy to bemoan the distance your job can take you from your personal goals. After all, you probably won’t even care about the task you’re working on a month from now, let alone when you’re retired. However, every one of your personal goals would be easier to achieve if you were more focused- and your professional tasks would benefit as well. If you keep your eyes open, you might find many aspects of your job that do overlap with what you want to achieve outside of work. <br><br>
III.<br><br>
&emsp;Bringing positive energy into work can only help whatever situation you’re in. Nothing is stopping you from being positive. Maybe there is a voice in your head telling you to hold it back a little bit- but do you really think that voice has your best interest in mind? 


<h2>2 Quotes from Others</h2>

Engineer <b>F.W. Taylor</b> on the role of systems in our world:<br><br>
&emsp;“In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be first. This in no sense, however, implies that great men are not needed. On the contrary, the first object of any good system must be that of developing first-class men; and under systematic management the best man rises to the top more certainly and more rapidly than ever before.”<br><br>
<i>Source: Principles of Scientific Management</i><br><br>
Writer <b>Thomas Pynchon</b> on religion and secularism:<br><br>
&emsp;"The basic problem," he proposes, "has always been getting other people to die for you. What’s worth enough for a man to give up his life? That’s where religion had the edge, for centuries. Religion was always about death. It was used not as an opiate so much as a technique—it got people to die for one particular set of beliefs about death. Perverse, natürlich, but who are you to judge? It was a good pitch while it worked. But ever since it became impossible to die for death, we have had a secular version—yours. Die to help History grow to its predestined shape. Die knowing your act will bring a good end a bit closer. Revolutionary suicide, fine. But look: if History’s changes are inevitable, why not not die? Vaslav? If it’s going to happen anyway, what does it matter?"<br><br>

<h2>1 Question for You</h2>
&emsp;If you could impersonate anyone from Family Guy, who would it be? What do you think would be the most challenging part of the voice? What quote would you say to get in character?

      <h2>The 3 Rules of Productivity, According to EVERY Billionaire </h2>
      <h5>Guru John Klinger, Nov 8, 2023</h5>
      <img src="billions.PNG" class="image">
     
<p>
You might not know this, but some people are productive. That's right, they actually do stuff. Not you though. You don't "produce". Unless you're going to take credit for digestion.<br>
<br>
You probably don't even know what being productive means! I mean, we're all just living, right?
Well, in one sense, yes. But in other sense, you're just living. Other people are creating.
They're exerting their will on the world and leaving behind "products" that other people can interact with and share.
Thus, some part of their soul leaves their mortal flesh and imbues some immortal mass of hydrocarbon and silicon.
Paying attention now? Yup, I thought so.
<br><br>
I am one of the few who produces, and not only do I produce, but my products beget production.
So while every productive person is linearly more productive than you, I hold a claim to being exponentially more so. 
But that exponential gap can be transformed into a linear one, and all it takes is you following 3 rules- 
3 simple rules that every productive person follows and you don't.
<br>
<h2>Rule # 1 : OOPS DISREGARD LOL </h2>
<h2>Rule # 2 : GUESS THESE DON'T APPLY TO YOU, </h2>
<h2>Rule # 3 : DO THEY? </h2>

      <h2>The 2nd Decennial John-Dylan Book Recommendation List </h2>
      <h5>Five (5) Books for (4) You (Dylan), Sep 3, 2023</h5>
      <img src="GWB.png" class="image">
      <p>Well, it's that time of the decade again. 
	Ten years have passed, which means Dylan has finished reading the five books I recommended him in 2013 and is ready for a new stack to keep him company through 2033. 
	Lucky for him, I've read ten books in the same time frame, so I can choose the five best from those and save him ten years. 
	Now , in no particular order, let's dive into these long-brewing recs.</p>
	<h3>House of Leaves - Mark Z. Danielewski</h3>
	<p>This was the coolest fiction book I've read lately and a real testament to its authors brilliance.
	He even insisted on type-setting this himself, which shows his devotion to his vision. 
	He worked on it for ten years and in that time weaved countless references and layers into this chronology
	of a house that's larger on the inside than the outside.</p>
	<h3>Atomic Habits - James Clear</h3>
	<p>
	The past year I've done a lot of management reading and, looking back, this book stands out as the best at spurring self-reflection.
	When I read self-management books I'm often left wondering if I should be directing my energy elsewhere.
	Like, I don't need to read a book to know some things I should be doing differently. 
	But the value of this book is that it's such an easy read that you really won't feel like you're using up any energy on it.
	As far as the actual science goes, you can probably get a better understanding through Charles Duhigg's "The Power of Habit",
	but, to my earlier point, stripping out the details for most is an advantage.
	This gives you a solid foundation that should lead to at least one area of your life being improved. 
	Bonus: This book took corporate America by storm last Christmas so there's a good chance your boss will want to discuss it (if you're so inclined).</p>
	<h3>Flow - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</h3>
	<p>The reason I was interested in management books was that I felt I needed to do a much better job managing myself.
	Also, I figured that solving how to motivate myself would help with motivating others, if that's ever necessary or valuable.
	I think this book really gets you close to the truth of motivation and understanding the self.
	A common criticism would be that the author bites off more than he can chew, which is fair, but the overall framework he provides is still much accurate than most people's default assumption.
	In general, if you're interested in pyschology you should get a lot out of this.</p>
	<h3>John Adams - David McCullough</h3>
	<p>Probably the most relatable historical figure I've come across, and with enough primary sources that it doesn't feel like wishful thinking saying that.
	Adams' challenges with work, love, and especially friendship are timeless and will have even the staunchest Monarchist celebrating his victories.</p>
	<h3>The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand</h3>
	<p>Ayn Rand gets discussed a lot as a political writer, but I find this book to be more of a Romantic experiment.
	What if you took everything you found beautiful about love and labor and separated them from what you found ugly?
	There's great dystopian worlbuilding (which I'm a sucker for), the characters are compelling, and there's some real poetry to be found in the dialogue. </p>
